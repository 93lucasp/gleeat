### What is Gleeat?


 Gleeat is a new experience and the first platform in the world which allow you to eat your meal talking with someone else.
 How many times you are alone during your dinner?
 Use Gleeat a new experience to meet new people from all over the world.
 This is the version beta so to use the service momentanely you need to have an skype account.
 
### How Gleeat works?
 
  It's easy to use, once you make your account you can look who is eating at that moment and call someone, you will know only the name and the age nothing else so who will be in the other side will a "surprise".
  Is that funny right?
